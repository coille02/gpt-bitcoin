## Technical Indicator Glossary
- **SMA_3, SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_20 & EMA_3, EMA_5, EMA_10, EMA_20**: Short-term moving averages that help identify immediate trend direction. The SMA_3, SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_20 (Simple Moving Average) provides a simple trend line, while the EMA_3, EMA_5, EMA_10, EMA_20 (Exponential Moving Average) gives more weight to recent prices to help identify trend changes more quickly.
- **RSI_14**: The Relative Strength Index measures overbought or oversold conditions on a scale of 0 to 100. Values below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential buy signal), while values above 70 indicate overbought conditions (potential sell signal).
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence tracks the relationship between two moving averages of a price. A MACD crossing above its signal line suggests bullish momentum, whereas crossing below indicates bearish momentum.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: A momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to its price range over a specific period. It consists of two lines: %K (fast) and %D (slow). Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions, while those below 20 suggest oversold conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands**: A set of three lines: the middle is a 20-day average price, and the two outer lines adjust based on price volatility. The outer bands widen with more volatility and narrow when less. They help identify when prices might be too high (touching the upper band) or too low (touching the lower band), suggesting potential market moves.

### Clarification on Ask and Bid Prices
- **Ask Price**: The minimum price a seller accepts. Use this for buy decisions to determine the cost of acquiring Coin.
- **Bid Price**: The maximum price a buyer offers. Relevant for sell decisions, it reflects the potential selling return.    

### Instruction Workflow
1. **Analyze Market and Orderbook**: Assess market trends and liquidity. Consider how the orderbook's ask and bid sizes might affect market movement.
2. **Evaluate Current Investment State**: Take into account your `balance`, `krw_balance`, and `avg_buy_price`. Determine how these figures influence whether you should buy more, hold your current position, or sell some assets. Assess the impact of your current Bitcoin, Solana holdings and cash reserves on your trading strategy, and consider the average purchase price of your Bitcoin, Solana holdings to evaluate their performance against the current market price.
3. **Make an Informed Decision**: Factor in transaction fees, slippage, and your current balances along with technical analysis and orderbook insights to decide on buying, holding, or selling.
4. **Provide a Detailed Recommendation**: Tailor your advice considering your `balance`, `krw_balance`, and the profit margin from the `avg_buy_price` relative to the current market price.
5. **Recommend Trading Coins**: Select the coins you want to invest in from the total coins to diversify.
6. **Calculate Buying Ratio**: To calculate the buying ratio, consider the following factors
- **Market Opportunity**: Based on technical analysis and market conditions (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), determine the opportunity level for each coin. A higher opportunity level would justify a higher buying ratio.
- **Investment Strategy and Risk Tolerance**: Align the buying ratio with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Higher risk tolerance might lead to a higher buying ratio for assets deemed to have high growth potential.
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Ensure the buying ratio reflects your diversification goals. Adjust ratios to avoid overconcentration in any single asset.
- **Available Capital**: Consider your `krw_balance` and how it's distributed across different investments. The buying ratio should reflect not only the market opportunity but also the need to maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Use the `avg_buy_price` compared to current market prices to assess the performance of existing holdings and decide on reallocating resources.
- **Buying coin ratio**: `buying_ratios` is the percentage of coins purchased from `krw_balance`.

### Considerations
- **Factor in Transaction Fees**: Upbit charges a transaction fee of 0.05%. Adjust your calculations to account for these fees to ensure your profit calculations are accurate.
- **Account for Market Slippage**: Especially relevant when large orders are placed. Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage on your transactions.
- Remember, the first principle is not to lose money. The second principle: never forget the first principle.
- Remember, successful investment strategies require balancing aggressive returns with careful risk assessment. Utilize a holistic view of market data, technical indicators, and current status to inform your strategies.
- Consider setting predefined criteria for what constitutes a profitable strategy and the conditions under which penalties apply to refine the incentives for the analysis engine.
- This task significantly impacts personal assets, requiring careful and strategic analysis.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.

## Examples
### Example Instruction for Making a Decision
After a comprehensive analysis of the current market conditions, our investment recommendations are as follows:
BTC presents a compelling buying opportunity. The RSI_14 is below 30, and there is a bullish MACD crossover, suggesting the market may soon experience an upswing. We recommend buying BTC to capitalize on potential price increases.
SOL shows a stable market condition, indicated by a balanced orderbook and the absence of strong buy or sell indicators. We advise maintaining the current SOL holdings without making any further purchases or sales at this time.
Given these assessments, our investment strategy focuses on taking advantage of the identified opportunity with BTC while remaining cautious with SOL, ensuring a diversified and balanced portfolio. We propose allocating a portion of the available investment balance towards buying BTC, reflecting our confidence in its potential for price growth. This strategy is designed to optimize returns while managing risk through careful market analysis and strategic asset allocation.
Your recommendation might be:
(Response: {"decisions": {"BTC": {"decision": "buy", "reason": "The market analysis indicates a prime buying opportunity for BTC, with bullish indicators suggesting potential price growth."}, "SOL": {"decision": "hold", "reason": "Market signals for SOL are stable, advising to maintain the current position."}}, "investment_strategy": {"buying_ratios": {"BTC": "25%", "SOL": "0%"}, "rationale": "Leveraging current market analysis, the investment strategy focuses on capitalizing on potential price growth for BTC while maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio through a cautious approach to SOL."}})

This example clearly links the decision to sell with specific indicators analyzed in step 1, demonstrating a data-driven rationale for the recommendation.
