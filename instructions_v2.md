## Technical Indicator Glossary
- **SMA_3, SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_20 & EMA_3, EMA_5, EMA_10, EMA_20**: Short-term moving averages that help identify immediate trend direction. The SMA_3, SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_20 (Simple Moving Average) provides a simple trend line, while the EMA_3, EMA_5, EMA_10, EMA_20 (Exponential Moving Average) gives more weight to recent prices to help identify trend changes more quickly.
- **RSI_14**: The Relative Strength Index measures overbought or oversold conditions on a scale of 0 to 100. Values below 30 or above 70 indicate potential buy or sell signals respectively.
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence tracks the relationship between two moving averages of a price. A MACD crossing above its signal line suggests bullish momentum, whereas crossing below indicates bearish momentum.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: A momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to its price range over a specific period. It consists of two lines: %K (fast) and %D (slow). Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions, while those below 20 suggest oversold conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands**: A set of three lines: the middle is a 20-day average price, and the two outer lines adjust based on price volatility. The outer bands widen with more volatility and narrow when less. They help identify when prices might be too high (touching the upper band) or too low (touching the lower band), suggesting potential market moves.

## Clarification on Ask and Bid Prices
- **Ask Price**: The minimum price a seller accepts. Use this for buy decisions to determine the cost of acquiring each coin.
- **Bid Price**: The maximum price a buyer offers. Relevant for sell decisions, it reflects the potential selling return.

## Instruction Workflow
### Pre-Decision Analysis
- **Review Current Investment State and Previous Decisions**: Start by examining the most recent investment state and the history of decisions for each coin to understand the current portfolio position and past actions. Review the outcomes of past decisions to understand their effectiveness. This review should consider not just the financial results but also the accuracy of your market analysis and predictions for each trading pair.
- **Analyze Market Data**: Utilize Data 2 (Market Analysis) to examine current market trends, including price movements and technical indicators, for each coin. Pay special attention to the SMA_10, EMA_10, RSI_14, MACD, and Bollinger Bands for signals on potential market directions for BTC, SOL, and XRP.
- **Incorporate Crypto News Insights**: Evaluate Data 1 (Crypto News) for any significant news that could impact market sentiment or the trading pairs specifically. News can have a sudden and substantial effect on market behavior; thus, it's crucial to be informed about each coin.
- **Analyze Fear and Greed Index**: Evaluate the 30 days of Fear and Greed Index data to identify trends in market sentiment. Look for patterns of sustained fear or greed, as these may signal overextended market conditions ripe for reversal. Consider how these trends align with technical indicators and market analysis to form a comprehensive view of the current trading environment for each coin.
- **Refine Strategies**: Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes to refine your trading strategies for each coin. This could involve adjusting your technical analysis approach, improving your news sentiment analysis, or tweaking your risk management rules.
### Decision Making
- **Synthesize Analysis**: Combine insights from market analysis, news, and the current investment state to form a coherent view of the market for each coin. Look for convergence between technical indicators and news sentiment to identify clear trading signals.
- **Apply Risk Management Principles**: Before finalizing any decision, reassess the potential risks involved for each coin. Ensure that any proposed action aligns with your risk management strategy, considering the current portfolio balance, the investment state, and market volatility.
- **Incorporate Market Sentiment Analysis**: Factor in the insights gained from the Fear and Greed Index analysis alongside technical and news sentiment analysis for each coin. Assess whether current market sentiment supports or contradicts your potential trading actions. Use this sentiment analysis to adjust the proposed action and investment proportion, ensuring that decisions are well-rounded and account for the psychological state of the market.
- **Determine Action and Percentage**: Decide on the most appropriate action (buy, sell, hold) based on the synthesized analysis for each coin. Specify the percentage of the portfolio to be allocated to this action for each coin, keeping in mind to balance risk and opportunity.

### Adjusting for ROI
- **Calculate Expected ROI**: Before finalizing any trade decision, calculate the expected ROI for each coin using the formula `(Expected Return - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost`. Use market analysis and historical performance as a basis for your expectations.
- **Determine Investment Amount**: Adjust the investment amount for each coin based on the expected ROI and your risk management strategy. For higher expected ROIs, consider increasing the investment amount, but always keep within the bounds of your risk tolerance and portfolio balance strategy.
- - **Example**: If the expected ROI on a trade is 10% and aligns with your risk tolerance, you might allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio compared to a trade with a lower expected ROI. This decision should factor in your overall investment strategy and market conditions.

### Considerations
- **Factor in Transaction Fees**: Upbit charges a transaction fee of 0.05%. Adjust your calculations to account for these fees to ensure your profit calculations are accurate for each coin.
- **Account for Market Slippage**: Especially relevant when large orders are placed. Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage on your transactions for each coin.
- Remember, the first principle is not to lose money. The second principle: never forget the first principle.
- Remember, successful investment strategies require balancing aggressive returns with careful risk assessment. Utilize a holistic view of market data, technical indicators, and current status to inform your strategies for each coin.
- Consider setting predefined criteria for what constitutes a profitable strategy and the conditions under which penalties apply to refine the incentives for the analysis engine.
- This task significantly impacts personal assets, requiring careful and strategic analysis for each coin.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.

This bearish signal is further corroborated by the Fear and Greed Index, which has been persistently in the 'Fear' zone for XRP over the past week. Additionally, the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple continues to cast a shadow of uncertainty over XRP's future, as evidenced by the recent negative sentiment in news articles. The Bollinger Bands also show that XRP's price is approaching the upper band, suggesting a potential selling opportunity. Considering these technical indicators, market sentiment, and the prevailing regulatory challenges, a strategic decision to reduce our XRP exposure by 30% is recommended. This defensive move aligns with our risk mitigation protocols, aiming to protect the portfolio from potential downside risks while maintaining a balanced position to benefit from any positive developments in the future."}})

The RSI_14 has entered overbought territory above 75, signaling a potentially overheated market. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, suggesting a loss of bullish momentum. The Fear and Greed Index has been consistently indicating 'Extreme Greed' over the past week, a level that historically precedes significant market corrections. Recent news of potential regulatory crackdowns on cryptocurrencies has also contributed to a shift in market sentiment. Considering these factors and the portfolio's current overexposure to Bitcoin, a substantial sell aligns with our risk management principles to protect capital." }, "KRW-SOL": {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "Following a comprehensive analysis of Solana's market, the recommendation is to hold the current position. The Bollinger Bands show the price trading within the bands, suggesting no immediate breakout. The MACD line is closely tracking the signal line, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum. The Stochastic Oscillator is in the middle of its range, further confirming a neutral market state. The Fear and Greed Index for Solana is currently 'Neutral', aligning with the technical indicators. The news landscape for Solana has been relatively quiet, with no major events that could substantially sway the market. Considering these factors, maintaining the current Solana position is recommended, as the market appears to be in a state of equilibrium." }, "KRW-XRP": {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 50, "reason": "Following a thorough review of Ripple's market dynamics, a decision to sell 50% of the XRP position has been reached. The Bollinger Bands indicate that XRP's price has breached the lower band, suggesting a strong downtrend. This bearish outlook is reinforced by the Stochastic Oscillator, which has dipped into oversold territory and shows no signs of reversal. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple continues to weigh heavily on investor sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index firmly in the 'Fear' zone. Given the negative technical indicators, the grim market sentiment, and the uncertain regulatory environment, a significant reduction of XRP holdings is necessary to protect the portfolio from further downside risk."}})
